I am a PhD student in the doctoral programme ["Logics for Computer Science"](https://www.vcla.at/msca/programme/) at TU Wien. I work under the supervision of [Prof. Agata Ciabattoni](https://www.logic.at/staff/agata/) within [Theory and Logic group](https://www.logic.at/).

My reseach focuses on developing proof- and model-theoretic methods for the investigation of logics for knowledge representation, with a particular emphasis on conditional logics.
