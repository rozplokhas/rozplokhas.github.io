  abstract     = {We present a computationally grounded semantics for counterfactual conditionals in which i) the state in a model is decomposed into two elements: a propositional valuation and a causal base in propositional form that represents the causal information available at the state; and ii) the comparative similarity relation between states is computed from the states’ two components. We show that, by means of our semantics, we can elegantly formalize the notion of actual cause without recurring to the primitive notion of intervention. Furthermore, we provide a succinct formulation of the model checking problem for a language of counterfactual conditionals in our semantics. We show that this problem is PSPACE-complete and provide a reduction of it into QBF that can be used for automatic verification of causal properties.}

We interpret our logic by means of computationally grounded semantics relying on the concept of belief base. The strength of the coalition's distributed belief is directly computed from the coalition's belief base after having merged its members' individual belief bases. We illustrate our logic with some intuitive examples and provide a sound and complete Hilbert-style axiomatization as well as a decidability result obtained via filtration. Last but not least, we present a decision procedure for our logic based on tableaux that allows us to state PSPACE-completeness for our logic.}

  abstract     = {{\AA}qvist's logics (E, F, F+(CM), and G) are among the best-known systems in the long tradition of preference-based approaches for modeling conditional obligation. While the general semantics of preference models align well with philosophical intuitions, more constructive characterizations are needed to assess computational complexity and facilitate automated deduction. Existing small model constructions from conditional logics (due to Friedman and Halpern) are applicable only to F+(CM) and G, while recently developed proof-theoretic characterizations leave unresolved the exact complexity of theoremhood in logic F. In this paper, we introduce alternative small model constructions assembled from elementary building blocks, applicable uniformly to all four {\AA}qvist's logics. Our constructions propose alternative semantical characterizations and imply co-NP-completeness of theoremhood. Furthermore, they can be naturally encoded in classical propositional logic for automated deduction.}

As a consequence of our results, we obtain new, simple semantics for all these logics, complexity bounds, embeddings into normal modal logics, and efficient deduction methods.

Here we investigate  Åqvist’s system F, a well-known logic in this family. F has the notable feature that every satisfiable formula has a “best” element. Thus far, the only proof system for F was a Hilbert calculus, impeding applications and deeper investigations. We fill this gap, constructing the first analytic calculus for F. The calculus possesses good proof-theoretical properties—in particular, cut-elimination, which greatly facilitates proof search. Our calculus is used to provide explanations of logical consequences, as a decision-making tool, and to obtain a preliminary complexity upper bound for F (giving a theoretical limit on its automated behavior).}

For example, Gentzen's classical and intuitionistic calculi LK and LJ enjoy cut elimination. The property is less studied in coinductive extensions of sequent calculi. In this paper, we use coinductive Horn clause theories to show that cut is not eliminable in a coinductive extension of LJ, a system we call CLJ. We derive two further practical results from this study. We show that CoLP by Gupta et al. gives rise to cut-free proofs in CLJ with fixpoint terms, and we formulate and implement a novel method of coinductive theory exploration that provides several heuristics for discovery of cut formulae in CLJ.}
