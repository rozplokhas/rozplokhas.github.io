  abstract     = {{\AA}qvist's logics (E, F, F+(CM), and G) are among the best-known systems in the long tradition of preference-based approaches for modeling conditional obligation. While the general semantics of preference models align well with philosophical intuitions, more constructive characterizations are needed to assess computational complexity and facilitate automated deduction. Existing small model constructions from conditional logics (due to Friedman and Halpern) are applicable only to F+(CM) and G, while recently developed proof-theoretic characterizations leave unresolved the exact complexity of theoremhood in logic F. In this paper, we introduce alternative small model constructions assembled from elementary building blocks, applicable uniformly to all four {\AA}qvist's logics. Our constructions propose alternative semantical characterizations and imply co-NP-completeness of theoremhood. Furthermore, they can be naturally encoded in classical propositional logic for automated deduction.}

  abstract     = {The key strength of preference-based logics for conditional obligation is their ability to handle contrary-to-duty paradoxes and account for exceptions. Here we investigate  Åqvist’s system F, a well-known logic in this family. F has the notable feature that every satisfiable formula has a “best” element. Thus far, the only proof system for F was a Hilbert calculus, impeding applications and deeper investigations. We fill this gap, constructing the first analytic calculus for F. The calculus possesses good proof-theoretical properties—in particular, cut-elimination, which greatly facilitates proof search. Our calculus is used to provide explanations of logical consequences, as a decision-making tool, and to obtain a preliminary complexity upper bound for F (giving a theoretical limit on its automated behavior).}
